<p>I2P Newsfeed build scripts which let me automatically transfer built news files to the server.</p>
<p>It might also be a mirror of my own signed newsfeeds in the future. To enable this, just remove the build directory from the <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>
<p>It assumes a Docker environment close to the defaults, for now. You must have newsfeed signing keys.</p>
<p>To use it, if you already have signing keys, simply set the hostname of the server you are using by creating a file <code>host</code> in this directory containing the hostname or IP address, then run <code>make all</code>.</p>
