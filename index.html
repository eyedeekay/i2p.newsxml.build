<p>I2P Newsfeed build scripts which let me automatically transfer built news files to the server. It might also be a mirror of my own signed newsfeeds in the future. It assumes a Docker environment close to the defaults, for now.</p>
<p>To use it, if you already have signing keys, simply set the hostname of the server you are using by creating a file <code>host</code> in this directory containing the hostname or IP address, then run <code>make all</code>.</p>
